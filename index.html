                                to bring this bridge back.

                            Taekwondo is originally a Korean martial art, where both hand and foot techniques are used.
                            The literal translation of the word Taekwondo is: "The way of the foot and the fist". The
                            word Taekwondo is made up of 3 parts:

                            Tae (foot). The foot represents all leg techniques such as kicking and jumping.

                            Kwon (fist). The hand stands for all hand and arm techniques such as punching, blocking,
                            grasping, clamping and throwing.

                            Do (the way). The road is the path that you follow while practicing Taekwondo and mainly
                            represents the mental part.

                                <h3>TAEKWONDO FOR CHILDREN</h3>
                                We offer children lessons at their own level! We divide the children into age-specific
                                groups. That happens in class, but also with separate hours. In this way a child gets
                                the attention it needs and to evolve further.

                                With us, taekwondo is more than kicking. For thousands of years, martial art has been
                                used for so much more than just self-defense. It helps children with discipline and
                                focus. They are more concentrated at school, gain self-confidence and have respect for
                                their parents and others. Every lesson the children train their fitness in a fun way.
                                Taekwondo keeps them healthy and strong, develops their balance, coordination and
                                strength. Taekwondo is offered by us for every level and every age (from 7 years).

                                <h3>TAEKWONDO FOR ADULTS</h3>

                                The adults can also come to us for an extensive range of training options. From 15 years
                                you can participate in the Taekwondo lessons for adults.

                                In addition to traditional taekwondo, these lessons also include influences from other
                                styles. Continuous work is being done to push boundaries through self-defense, sparring
                                and traditional training. In this way you are challenged to continue to develop. We do
                                all of this in an infectious and positive environment, so that you leave the school full
                                of energy and look forward to the next training.



                                <h3>BASIC TECHNIQUES</h3>

                                The basis of the Taekwondo is formed by a good position and the ability to properly
                                implement all kinds of separate arm and leg techniques. Both beginners and advanced
                                students spend a lot of time and attention learning these basic techniques.

                                <h3>POOMSE, STYLE FORMS</h3>

                                The style forms portray a sham fight. A fixed sequence of attack and defense techniques
                                is then carried out against an imaginary opponent. Mastering style forms shows which
                                skills a Taekwondoin is capable of. Characteristics such as strength, balance, dynamics
                                and appearance must be sufficiently developed. The poomses are therefore an important
                                part of the taekwondo and are central during the tire exam.

                                <h3>KYORUGI, SPARRING</h3>

                                Kyorugi is a part for which many championships are organized. Within Hwa-Rang Dragon,
                                however, we do not only train on Olympic (WTF) firs. The longer you train, the more you
                                practice on spruce with boxing gloves and on ground combat (TKMudo). During sparring,
                                sufficient protection is worn, such as chest, head, crotch, arm and shin instep
                                protectors, a bit and boxing gloves. This protection makes it possible to spar with each
                                other in a safe and responsible manner.

                                <h3>HOSINSUL, SELF DEFENSE</h3>

                                In the hosinsul section, various defenses are practiced against all kinds of attacks
                                with weapons and attacks without weapons, such as seizures or clamps. It is important to
                                know how to fall. That is why we explicitly pay attention to it
